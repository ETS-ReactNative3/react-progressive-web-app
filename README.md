## PWA using React

**Demo:** http://bit.ly/2Pzy35m

Single-page applications may be *smooth, quick, and effective*â€”but they disappear when *the network connection drops.* **Progressive web apps (PWAs) work offline**, enhancing resilience and allowing developers create seamless user experiences that feel like native apps. 

Learned how to build my own **PWAs using React**, the flexible front-end framework, in this [course](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/react-building-progressive-web-apps-pwas/) with Eve Porcello. Eve explained how to build the PWA component, fetch data, use Lighthouse to validate your app, and add offline capabilities to keep my app running even when the internet is down. Plus, learned how to install my app locally with browsers like Chrome and Safari for iOS.

If you want to use my codes, please clone the repo then run:

    npm install
Then run the app locally using the below command:

    npm start
After that build the React App using the below command:

    npm run build
Finally you will get a **build** folder inside the project folder, you can use this folder to deploy the app in [netlify](https://app.netlify.com).
